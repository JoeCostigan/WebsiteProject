The webpage will leverage a premade template/bootstrap to reduce the amount of development needed. 
There will be an overview page and at least 3 pages that can be navigated to. 
The navigated pages will each hold their own paragraph of information. 
I will try and use a map to cover travel.
I will attempt to use the same theme throughout the page (i.e. same navigation bar on each page, same color/font, etc)
